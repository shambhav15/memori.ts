[TRANSCRIPT: STARTUP WEEKLY SYNC - "PROJECT CHIMERA"]
[Attendees: Sarah (CEO), Mike (CTO), Emily (Product), David (Intern)]

Sarah: Alright everyone, let's get started. Big week ahead.
Mike: Can we make this quick? I've got the server migration at 2 PM.
Emily: I still haven't received the updated slide deck for the investor pitch.
David: Uh, I think I sent that? Let me check my sent folder... wait, no, it's in drafts.
Sarah: David, please get that out by end of day. It's critical.
Mike: Speaking of critical, did anyone touch the AWS keys? My access was denied this morning.
Emily: Not me. I was working on the Figma prototypes all night.
David: I might have tried to log in to check the logs? I guessed the password a few times.
Mike: David! You triggered the security lockout. The new admin password is 'BlueSky$99'—and don't type it in wrong again.
Sarah: Write that down securely, David. We can't afford verify-code delays. 
Emily: Moving on—user testing results are in for the 'Dark Mode' feature.
Sarah: And?
Emily: Mixed. 40% of users couldn't find the toggle. It's hidden under 'Advanced Settings'.
Mike: That was a backend decision. The legacy codebase breaks if we move it to the main header.
Sarah: We need to fix that. Project Chimera depends on a sleek UI.
David: What actually *is* Project Chimera? I just started last week.
Sarah: It's our pivot to AI-driven cat toys. But that's top secret.
Mike: Like, seriously David. If this leaks, we lose the Series B funding from 'CapitalOne Ventures'.
Emily: Did we secure that funding? I thought they were on the fence.
Sarah: They signed the term sheet yesterday. $5M at a $20M valuation.
David: Wow. That buys a lot of catnip.
Mike: Focus, people. The API latency on the laser pointer controller is 500ms. It needs to be under 100ms.
Emily: Maybe we switch from Python to Go?
Mike: START OVER in Go? Are you insane? We launch in 3 weeks.
Sarah: What if we just cache the movement patterns?
Mike: Hmmm. Maybe. Memcached implementation would take 2 days.
Emily: I can update the roadmap. So, launch date is still October 15th?
Sarah: No, we pushed it to November 1st to align with 'National Cat Day'.
David: My cat's birthday is November 3rd!
Mike: Irrelevant, David.
Sarah: Okay, let's talk budget. We're burning $50k a month.
Emily: That marketing campaign for 'Purr-fect Match' was expensive.
David: I liked the billboard though. The giant whisker was cool.
Mike: It cost $12,000 and drove exactly 4 signups.
Sarah: Lesson learned. Organic growth only from now on.
Emily: I've got a lead on an influencer. 'TabbyTammy' on TikTok. 
Sarah: Reach out to her. Offer her 2% equity if she can get us 10k users.
Mike: Equity? That's steep.
Sarah: It's cheaper than cash right now.
David: Can I have equity?
Mike: Finish the slide deck first.
Emily: Oh, before I forget—the office lease is up. Are we renewing?
Sarah: No, we're going fully remote starting December. Save the $8k rent.
Mike: Thank god. The commute is killing me.
David: But free coffee...
Sarah: Buy your own coffee, David.
Emily: Back to Chimera. The ultrasonic sound feature... is it safe?
Mike: Legal says yes, as long as it's under 20kHz. Ours is 18kHz.
Sarah: Good. Put that in the legal disclaimer anyway.
David: I heard a rumor that 'DogGo', our competitor, is launching a smart collar.
Sarah: Where did you hear that?
David: Reddit. r/Startups.
Mike: We need to accelerate. If they launch first, Chimera looks like a copycat.
Sarah: Pun intended?
Mike: No.
Emily: I'll prioritize the 'Bark Detection' module. It can disable the laser if a dog is near.
Sarah: Brilliant. That's a USP. 
David: Wait, I think I locked myself out of the AWS console again.
Mike: DAVID. The password is 'BlueSky$99'. Capital B. Capital S.
Sarah: Okay, wrap it up.
1. Fix the toggle UI.
2. Optimize API latency with Memcached.
3. Emily, contact TabbyTammy.
4. David, send the slides.
5. Everyone prep for November 1st launch.
Mike: I'll be in the server room. Don't disturb me unless the building is on fire.
Emily: Or if TabbyTammy replies.
Sarah: Meeting adjourned.
